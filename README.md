This is V2 of my personal blog of album reviews. The first one can be found [here](https://github.com/jmmd2000/AlbumReviews).

The first one was built with just React, JS, CSS and react-router.
This one is built using the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/): Next.js, TypesScript, tRPC, Prisma, TailwindCSS.

A step up from the V1, V2 will be fully typesafe, with a proper backend and better built UI.
